### Documentation for Netflix Clone


The `index.html` file is the main HTML document for a Netflix-like streaming service tailored for the Indian market. It features a responsive design suitable for various devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. The document is structured to present information about the service, including membership benefits, device compatibility, and FAQs. The styling of the page is managed through an external stylesheet located at `/css/style.css`.



#### Structure of `index.html`


- **Doctype and Language**: The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and specifies English (`en`) as the primary language.
  
- **Head Section**:
  - Character set and viewport settings are defined for proper rendering and touch zooming.
  - The document's title is set to "Netflix India â€“ Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online".
  - A link to the external stylesheet (`style.css`) is included for styling the page.


- **Body Section**:
  - **Navigation Bar**: Contains the Netflix logo and a language selection dropdown, along with a "Sign In" button.
  - **Hero Section**: Promotes the service with catchy phrases and includes an email input field for starting or restarting membership.
  - **Feature Sections**: Multiple sections (`<section>`) highlight the benefits of the service, such as device compatibility, offline downloads, and child-friendly content. These sections alternate between text and media (images and videos) to visually engage the user.
  - **FAQ Section**: Lists frequently asked questions to address common inquiries about the service. Each question is accompanied by a plus icon, suggesting expandable answers (though the functionality is not defined in the HTML).
  - **Footer**: Provides contact information, links to additional resources like FAQs and privacy policies, and repeats the language selection dropdown. It also includes a mention of "Netflix India".


#### `style.css` (Hypothetical Content)
The style.css file is responsible for the visual presentation of the index.html document. While the actual contents of style.css are not provided, it likely includes:

- **Layout Styles**: Defines the overall layout grid, spacing, and alignment of elements within the navigation bar, hero section, feature sections, FAQ section, and footer.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes for different screen widths, ensuring the website is accessible on devices ranging from smartphones to desktop computers.
- **Color Scheme and Typography**: Establishes a color palette consistent with the Netflix brand, along with font styles for headings, body text, and interactive elements.
- **Interactive Elements**: Styles for buttons, dropdowns, and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
- **Icons and Images**: Defines the size and alignment of icons (from FontAwesome) and images used throughout the page.


#### Conclusion

The `index.html` and `style.css` files together create a user-friendly and visually appealing web page for Netflix India, designed to inform potential subscribers about the service and encourage sign-ups. The HTML structure is semantic and organized, facilitating maintenance and future updates, while the external CSS ensures a clean separation of content and presentation.
